# com_wog_confrooms

Zimlet for Classic Zimbra UI.
Tested on Zimbra 9.0.0_ZEXTRAS_20221203 (build 20221216110431).

Add new Tab, that displays FullCalendar week view (throw attached JSP file) with calendars of person listed on calendars.json.
Positioned as simple view tab for couple conference rooms of organization, without displaying appointment details. 
Only subject and organizer.

Classic calendar sharing is less usefull if you value your safety.
